# StaticPricingforQueues
This repo contains a jupyter notebook which is used to produce the numerical results found in the article "Static Pricing for Queueing Systems."

To reproduce the results, scroll to the cell which starts with "#Test Parameters." Then enter the number of servers you want to test, the demand type, and the number of instances. After running the cell, the performance ratios are contained in 6 different lists. The next few cells report the mean and the minimum of the performance ratios for the instances just run.
